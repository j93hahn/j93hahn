- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is Joshua Ahn and I am a second-year computer science major at The University of Chicago. I currently live in both Evanston and Chicago in Illinois. I gathered my first software engineering experiences at Opal while also gaining research experience at Northwestern's CIERA Institute. I am passionate about developing ethical and reliable code for different software products and algorithms, and I intend on specializing in machine learning algorithms in my academic studies. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer vision research, and am currently part of a research group at the TTIC in Chicago, IL where I am working on developing an algorithm that can permute pixels using an Nvidia GPU and Tensorflow as part of an overarching research project. I am also interested in software development opportunities. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in R, and am also learning how to use Nvidia CUDA. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me at my email address (jjahn@uchicago.edu)!
